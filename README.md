# e-manifest

## Background
  The overarching purpose of e-Manifest is to establish a national information technology system that will enable the Agency and the hazardous waste program’s industry and state stakeholders to transition the manifest system from one that is paper-intensive and burdensome to a system that is much more efficient, because it will rely on information technology to track hazardous waste shipments

## What is going on
*In 2014 and 2015 EPA developed a technical architecture for e-Manifest.

*Between July of 2015 and March of 2016 EPA developed an inital prototype

*Since April of 2016 e-Manifest has been merging with the RCRAInfo V6 application taking advantage of reusing the data and technology that already existed in RCRAInfo.

   All our active cards and [issues] (/issues) are posted here.  We will be posting additional documents as well as issues that we want 
   user feedback on in the near future.
